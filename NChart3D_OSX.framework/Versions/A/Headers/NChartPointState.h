/**
 * The NChartPointState class provides methods to store state of a point. The state of a point is a complex of parameters
 * such as position, brush used etc. for a particular period for a particular point. Each chart point should have at
 * least one state representing the data from the data source for this point, but it can have multiple states. This
 * allows the animation of a chart through time, while each NChartPointState represents the state of the point in a
 * particular time tick. The transition from one state to another is animated automatically by linear interpolation of
 * parameters stored in the states.
