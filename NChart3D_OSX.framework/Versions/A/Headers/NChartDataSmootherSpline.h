/**
 * The NChartDataSmootherSpline class provides data smoother based on cubic defect 1 splines used to create smooth lines
 * on the charts by only a few points. Typically this smoother is used for line and area series.
 * @note This smoother ensures the best smoothing in comparison with <NChartDataSmootherTBezier> and
 * <NChartDataSmootherSBezier>, but has large deviation from the linear data interpolation and can produce large fake 
 * extremums.
