/**
 * The NChartDataSmootherLagrange class provides data smoother based on Lagrange polynoms used to create smooth lines
 * on the charts by only a few points. Typically this smoother is used for line and area series.
 * @note This smoother ensures the best smoothing in comparison with <NChartDataSmootherTBezier> and
 * <NChartDataSmootherSBezier>, but has large deviation from the linear data interpolation (even larger than 
 * <NChartDataSmooterSpline>) and can produce large fake extremums. It may be good for some, but generally it's
 * recommended to use <NChartDataSmootherTBezier> instead.
