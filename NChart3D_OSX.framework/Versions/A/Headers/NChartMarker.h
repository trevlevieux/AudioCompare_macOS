/**
 * The NChartMarker class provides methods to display markers in the points of the chart. 
 * <br>
 * Each series, that can display markers, has the property default marker. If you set it to series, this will be a 
 * default for all the points. However you can set the marker for the point and those values, that you set to this 
 * marker, will override the corresponding values from the default marker. For example, if you set the marker for series
 * and change its size, shape and resolution, and after that set another marker to some point and change its size, all
 * points will have the markers with shape and resolution from the default marker. The size of all points except the one
 * you modified will also be the same (obtained from default marker too). And the modified point will differ in size.
