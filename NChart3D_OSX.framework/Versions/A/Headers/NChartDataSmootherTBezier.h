/**
 * The NChartDataSmootherTBezier class provides data smoother based on bezier interpolation 
 * (with control points calculated according to tangents to the curve being smoothed)
 * used to create smooth lines on the charts by only a few points. 
 * Typically this smoother is used for line and area series.
 * @note This smoother ensures minimal deviation from the linear data interpolation (in comparison with
 * <NChartDataSmootherSpline>, <NChartDataSmootherLagrange> and <NChartDataSmootherSBezier>) and guarantees the absence
 * of fake extremums.
