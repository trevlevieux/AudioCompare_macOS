 * Relative threshold represents a fraction of |max - min|, where max is the maximal value in the given points array and
 * min is the minimal one.
 * So if, for example, min = 0, max = 10, threshold is set to 0.3 and this flag is YES, then the actual threshold the 
 * peaks will be search according to will be 0.3.
 * But if this flag is NO, the actual threshold will be 0.3 * (10 - 0) = 3.
 * Normally it's reasonable to use relative threshold if you don't know the bounds of your values. However, this will 
 * mean an additional scan through the points to determine min and max values, so the processing will take a bit more
