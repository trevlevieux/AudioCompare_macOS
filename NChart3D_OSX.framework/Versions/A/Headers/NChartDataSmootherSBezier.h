/**
 * The NChartDataSmootherSBezier class provides data smoother based on bezier interpolation
 * (with control points calculated to ensure defect 1 spline) used to create smooth lines on the charts by only a few points.
 * Typically this smoother is used for line and area series.
 * @note This smoother ensures better smoothing in comparison with <NChartDataSmootherTBezier>, but has larger deviation 
 * from the linear data interpolation and can produce fake extremums. However, the deviation of the fake extremums is
 * smaller in comparison with <NChartDataSmootherSpline> and <NChartDataSmootherLagrange>.
